## Hack

- We developed a project that is based on the Tezos blockchain . Our website incentivizes users based on the likes their answers receive. Users can connect to our website using a template wallet that has a Tezos ID. Once they log in, they can post questions and receive answers from other users. If an answer gets five upvotes or more, the user who provided the answer can request an NFT reward.

- To make this possible, we developed a smart contract on the Tezos blockchain that stores and manages user questions and answers, along with the corresponding likes and rewards. We created a user interface that allows users to interact with the smart contract, enabling them to post questions, answer questions, and upvote answers.

- We defined a reward system based on the number of upvotes received by a user's answer. If a user gets five upvotes or more, they become eligible for an NFT reward. The NFTs images are stored in ***Filecoin - Pinanta***. We also defined criteria for approving and minting NFTs. For example, the user's answer must be correct, relevant, and helpful to other users.

- We created an NFT minting process that can be triggered by the admin once a user's answer has met the criteria for approval. This process involves verifying the user's identity and generating a unique NFT for that user.

- Unlike the web 2.0 counterparts, these NFTs will endure even if the platform goes down in the future, serving as a permanent record of the user's accomplishments. This aligns with the ethos of blockchain technology, which is all about creating secure and immutable records. By integrating this technology with a collaborative developer community, we hope to incentivize more knowledge-sharing and skill-building, while also recognizing and celebrating the contributions of those who participate

<!-- Question -->

## How does Replit align with the project?
The project, which incentivizes developers to contribute solutions to coding problems by rewarding them with NFTs, could fit into a Replit track focused on fostering collaborative problem-solving and skill-building within the developer community. By leveraging the collaborative features of Replit, such as the ability to share and collaborate on code, developers could work together to find solutions to problems and build upon each other's knowledge. Additionally, the project's focus on incentivizing contributions through NFT rewards could align with Replit's emphasis on creating a supportive and empowering environment for developers, ultimately helping them to grow and thrive in their careers.

## How does Filecoin align with the project?
Our project leverages the power of Filecoin to store and retrieve the data associated with each NFT minted on our platform. By utilizing Filecoin's decentralized storage network, we are able to ensure that each NFT and its associated data is stored in a secure and reliable manner, with high availability and durability. This provides our users with the confidence that their contributions will be permanently recorded and available, even in the event of data loss or system failures. Additionally, by integrating with the Filecoin network, we are able to offer our users a more cost-effective and efficient storage solution compared to traditional centralized storage options. Our project is an exciting example of how Filecoin's decentralized storage technology can be leveraged to support emerging use cases, and we're proud to be part of the Filecoin track
