## Hack

- We developed a project that is based on the Tezos blockchain . Our website incentivizes users based on the likes their answers receive. Users can connect to our website using a template wallet that has a Tezos ID. Once they log in, they can post questions and receive answers from other users. If an answer gets five upvotes or more, the user who provided the answer can request an NFT reward.

- To make this possible, we developed a smart contract on the Tezos blockchain that stores and manages user questions and answers, along with the corresponding likes and rewards. We created a user interface that allows users to interact with the smart contract, enabling them to post questions, answer questions, and upvote answers.

- We defined a reward system based on the number of upvotes received by a user's answer. If a user gets five upvotes or more, they become eligible for an NFT reward. We also defined criteria for approving and minting NFTs. For example, the user's answer must be correct, relevant, and helpful to other users.

- We created an NFT minting process that can be triggered by the admin once a user's answer has met the criteria for approval. This process involves verifying the user's identity and generating a unique NFT for that user.
